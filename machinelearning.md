# Overview

For this I analyzed heart disease data and the target heart rate and analyzed their data. I then found the line of best fit for the data allowing the code to
potentially learn. I used the R language in VS code and R studio. I wrote this to help me practice using R and give me more practice using machine learning equations.

# Machine Learning Results

I found the line of best fit for your target heart rate and heart disease

# Development Environment

I used R studio and VS code. I used the r programing languages so I didn't need to use any libraries

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* The data was slightly different from my Python machine learning code so I will have to look over them both and fix any discrepancies.
* I will want to try and add a pie chart next time with the data.
* Also next time I want to implement more R built in functions.
